# SebLague-Chess-Challenge-Entry

My entry for Sebastian Lague's [Tiny Chess Bot Challenge](https://youtu.be/iScy18pVR58)

**Disclaimer:** I know very little (basically nothing) about chess

## Concept

score moves based on a priority system (highest to lowest):
- checkmate
- attack enemy king
- take enemy piece
- move closer to enemy king
- move closer to enemy piece
